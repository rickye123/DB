Java Assignment 1 - Oxo Extension

For the extension task, I decided to create an AI to allow the user to play 
against the computer. However, rather than creating an AI which makes the 
game potentially "unwinnable", e.g. the minimax algorithm, I have decided to 
create characteristics for the computer that makes its moves less intelligent, 
but not idiotic. 

An AI for a Noughts and Crosses game should follow these rules: 
1. If the game can be won by a move, take it; 
2. Otherwise, if the user can win from the next move, block that move. 

Therefore, this AI implements these two mechanisms, first checking to see
if the game is winnable, then if this is false attempting to block the user
from winning. If neither possibility is true, the AI selects a position on 
the board by random.

The user can also determine who goes first, them or the computer, by simply
typing "User" or "Computer" into the terminal when prompted. These are 
safeguarded and will display an error if input is incorrect. 

In addition, as this expands on the first Oxo game, the user has the choice to
either play against the computer or play two player. 

To Run:
Entering "make run" into the terminal should run the game. If this fails, 
entering java Oxo should suffice. For testing, "java -ea Oxo" needs to be used. 
For compiling, simply entering "make" should work. If this fails, just need 
to enter "javac Oxo.java Board.java Display.java Symbols.java Positon.java
AI.java Testing.java".
