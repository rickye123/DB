This was the final stage of development. In the previous stage, the database class
was removed to allow each class to work independently of any control. Now, the 
Database class is used to wrap everything up from the previous classes. 

This class allows for multiple tables to be stored in a database that the user can
create. As an extension, a database folder could be created and the tables written 
to files inside that folder. This was something touched upon in the extension task. 

Meanwhile, this class contains an arraylist of tables called database which can 
be manipualted in a similar way to the table arraylist in Table.java. These tables
can have records selected, updated, or created, as well as completely removed. 

This stage of development involved taking all the concepts from the prior phases and 
linking them together to make a general purpose database. 

All the unit testing was finished at this stage of development and again proved to 
be a useful way to debug the program. Many issues arose when trying to reference
a position of a table in the List<Table> database arraylist. Many functions worked
without any errors, and it wasn't until unit testing that many bugs were discovered. 
IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions were thrown for the methods referencing a positioin in the 
table, meaning this had to be changed to reference the number of tables in the 
arraylist.
