In the fourth stage of development, the Upload class was updated, allowing for tables
to be written to text files. This stage and the prior stage were split up due to 
problems that arose when deciding the format of the files. Moreover, problems arose
when writing to files as a newline character has to be written so that when the
file was read back in, the readFromFile function knows where a record ends. 

The Database class is still used as a control class at this point (though it will 
change in the next phase of development). 

Minimal testing was done at this stage bar some debugging on the readFromFile and 
writeToFile functions. Otherwise, the Record.java and Table.java classes stayed
more or less the same.
