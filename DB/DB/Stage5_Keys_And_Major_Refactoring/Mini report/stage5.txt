The transition between stages 4 and 5 is possibly the largest between phases of 
development. Notably, the Table class was updated to allow for table names to be 
added (using a constructor). This was optional, however, taking a variable length
of String arguments so that it wasn't necessary to include the table name when 
creating a table object. The table name is given the identifier "untitled" if 
the table object takes no parameters. 

Furthermore, the moveRowsUp and replaceRow methods were removed as the .remove() 
method proved to be a more effective way of completely removing records. Moreover, 
most of the tables were edited to return boolean values to make testing slightly 
easier. 

In addition, keys was an important element of this phase of development. The Key 
class was created which searches a table to see if fields in the key column have
duplicates. If there are duplicates in the key column, a boolean value is returned. 

Moreover, the Print class was created to handle printing to the terminal in a 
clean and precise way. When a table is printed, it is first formatted. This is
where the max field length of each column is calculated and returned into an array
of integers called maxFieldLengths. This allows the table to be of a varied size 
depending on the length of the fields in each column. 

All these changes meant that a lot of the unit tests had to be redone for most of 
the classes. This was a useful way of finding bugs in the program, however, as many
problems were found and solved by unit testing the functions in the Table.java 
class.
