In this stage, the Upload.java class was added to handle input and output from 
files. A readFromFile method was created which would accept a file name and 
a Table class. 

Only readable text files are permitted, meaning that they must adhere to a 
certain format, i.e. contain fields separated by a semi-colon (':') character. 

In the Table class, a readFromFile method was created which allowed text files to 
be read into tables. This was one of the shortest stages of development that only
included reading in text files and nothing else. These methods would be completely
changed in further stages of development.
